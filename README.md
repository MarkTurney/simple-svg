<p><strong>simple-svg</strong> is a single file header-only C++ library for creating SVG files.</p>
<p>Simple-SVG was written to provide an easy API to allow beginners to become more accustomed to C++ by easily creating graphics.</p>
<p>This project creates files that can then be viewed by a sister project <a href="https://github.com/MarkTurney/file-monitor" rel="nofollow">File Monitor</a>.  As you make changes to your SVG document, you will automatically see an updated image in File Monitor.</p>
